The user is asking for an app that supports messages and calls. I think a comprehensive answer would include a full-stack plan with tech stack, UI, sample code, and APIs. Since WebRTC is necessary for calls, I'll include WebSocket signaling and WebRTC integration. I'll structure a simple React app example with messaging and peer-to-peer calls, leveraging Tailwind for styling.

I think I should include a Node.js Express and Socket.IO server for messaging and call signaling, but since I can only create one file, I can add all the code (including server code) in a single React component file. I'll add a short explanation and link, and make sure I follow the guidelines!
